Currently working on building a single instrument, index futures trading engine that uses orderbook data and deep learning (not decided on the specific approach) to trade at a high frequency.  It's likely that many more projects will be posted here.  It's unlikely that any of them will be useful.  Do not use anything here to trade or make financial decisions, unless you enjoy losing money, your customers, and potentially your job.  Nothing on here is financial advice, it's just research.  I will not be held responsible for the use of anything I create that is used with or without authorization from yours truly. :)))
